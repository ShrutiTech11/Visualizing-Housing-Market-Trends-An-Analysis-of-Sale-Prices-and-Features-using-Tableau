An Analysis of Sale Prices and Features Using Tableau

üìå Project Overview
The project explores factors that influence house prices and sales trends by analyzing a comprehensive housing dataset. Using Tableau, we visualize relationships between renovations, house age, features (bathrooms, bedrooms, floors), and sales prices to uncover actionable insights that help optimize pricing strategies and improve market competitiveness. Key stakeholders include real estate analysts, marketing teams, and company executives

üéØ Objectives

Identify key factors that influence house prices and sales trends.

Visualize the impact of renovations and house age on sales price.

Explore distributions of house features (bathrooms, bedrooms, floors) across age groups.

Provide interactive dashboards in Tableau for stakeholder decision-making.

 üîç Key Scenarios & Visualizations

Scenario 1 ‚Äî Overall Data Overview

Type: KPI summary / Overview
What it shows: Count of transformed records, average sales price, total basement area (ft¬≤).
Purpose: Quick snapshot of dataset scale and critical metrics for stakeholders.

Scenario 2 ‚Äî Total Sales by Years Since Renovation

Type: Histogram (sales price bins vs. years-since-renovation)
What it shows: Distribution of total sales across years since renovation and associated price bins.
Purpose: Reveal how renovation recency correlates with sales price ranges and buyer preferences.

Scenario 3 ‚Äî Distribution of House Age by Renovation Status

Type: Pie chart (age groups √ó renovation status)
What it shows: Proportion of houses in each age group split by whether they were renovated.
Purpose: Assess the prevalence of renovations across different age brackets of housing stock.

Scenario 4 ‚Äî House Age Distribution by Bathrooms, Bedrooms & Floors

Type: Grouped bar chart
What it shows: House age distribution segmented by number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and floors.
Purpose: Understand feature patterns by age and identify target segments for marketing or pricing.

üõ† Tools Used

Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public ‚Äî primary visualization and dashboard develpment.

Python / Pandas ‚Äî data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering (optional steps before Tableau).

Git / GitHub ‚Äî version control and repository hosting.

CSV / Parquet ‚Äî typical dataset formats used.

Future Enhancements

Add geospatial maps (choropleth, density) to visualize price trends by neighborhood.

Incorporate external data: interest rates, local economic indicators, school ratings.

Forecasting module: basic time-series forecasts of average prices using ARIMA/Prophet and visualize results in Tableau.

Build role-specific dashboard views for executives, analysts, and sales teams.
